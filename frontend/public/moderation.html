    <h1>Moderation & Safety Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 1, 2026</p>
    
    <p>At AU RadioChat, we balance absolute privacy with uncompromising safety. This document outlines how we maintain a safe environment for all adult users.</p>

    <h2>1. Multi-Layered Safety Architecture</h2>
    <p>Our moderation system operates on three primary levels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Layer 1: Real-time Filtering (Pre-send)</strong><br>Our engine calculates a Trust Score for every user based on verified location data and behavior. Users with suspicious patterns are restricted from sending media or links.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 2: Automated Analysis (Post-send)</strong><br>Messages are passed through localized profanity and threat detection filters. Flagged content is immediately blocked from the recipient.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 3: Community Vigilance</strong><br>Recipients have the power to "Block" and "Report" any sender instantly. Reported content is archived for human review for 24 hours before being purged.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Reporting Procedures</h2>
    <p>When a user clicks the "Report" button:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The reporting user is asked to select a reason (Spam, Harassment, Inappropriate Content, etc.).</li>
        <li>The system automatically blocks communication between the two parties.</li>
        <li>A log containing the incident details is sent to our decentralized moderation queue.</li>
        <li>Review occurs within 24 hours. If a violation is confirmed, the offender is banned for 1 day, 1 week, or permanently.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. Transparency</h2>
    <p>We do not store transcripts for the sake of marketing or tracking. Moderation logs are the ONLY data we store longer than 60 seconds, and they are purged once the resolution is reached or after 30 days maximum.</p>
