    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 1, 2026</p>
    
    <p>StreamFlow ("we," "our," or "us") provides a private, ephemeral communication platform. Your privacy is our core mission. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We minimize data collection to the absolute necessity for providing the service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We collect your email address for initial authentication (OTP). We do not store passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> User-provided name, age (to verify 18+ status), gender, and approximate location (country/city) to enable search functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> We collect device identifiers and IP addresses solely for security, anti-spam, and rate-limiting purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Ephemeral Content</h2>
    <p>StreamFlow is designed for private, temporary communication:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Messages & Media:</strong> Messages and media files are deleted automatically from our servers shortly after delivery (typically within 30-60 seconds).</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Storage:</strong> We do not maintain a permanent database of your chat history. Once a message expires or is deleted by the system, it is purged forever.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. User Generated Content (UGC) Safety</h2>
    <p>To comply with app store regulations and ensure user safety, we use automated filters to detect and block illegal or highly offensive content. We also provide reporting mechanisms (Flagging) to allow users to report violations.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your profile data is retained for up to 60 days following your last activity to maintain your session. You can delete your account and all associated data at any time via the "Delete Account" button in the app settings.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy occasionally. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the date at the top of this policy.</p>
